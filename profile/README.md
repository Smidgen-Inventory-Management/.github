<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->
<!-- We cannot replace the use in medicine because a fully fledged CMMS requires much more information -->
Smidgen is a logistics management solution designed to be adaptable to any market use, ranging from IT to Automotives, Engineering to Aeronautics, and so on. Too many times does countless hours get spent trying to input new equipment to a businesses's inventory, only to then find out that asset A is a slight variation of Asset B, or the business utilizes a unified database to store all of their assets or mixed types.

Smidgen aims to simplify the process, as well as give businesses full control over how their data is manipulated through a straight-forward user interface.
